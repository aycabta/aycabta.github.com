It's very easy and be benefited, make sure you try them out.

Advantages
----------

* easy to embed gist
* easy to syntax highlighting
* easy to write with chosen notation, markdown and others
* GitHub provides hosting

One of the perils of this way is ability to handle a lot of access.
I want to know how far GitHub Pages can scales.

Technologies used
-----------------

* GitHub Pages

* Jekyll (internal)

Preview

``` bash Preview for Octopress
$ rake preview

And access localhost:4000 in a web browser. It's very easy.
